## Description :pushpin: 
- Maintaining a consistent supplement routine is often hindered by forgetfulness and lack of
motivation, leading to potential health problems. To address this issue, we propose
developing a mobile Android application that gamifies supplement tracking, where users care
for a virtual pet whose well-being depends on their adherence to their supplement routine.
